**👋 Hey!**

I'm Spencer Woo.

- 🎓 PhD student at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://cst.bit.edu.cn/) (2022 - present).
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 MSc (CS) graduate at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) with distinction (2021 - 2022).
- 🇨🇳 BSc (CS) graduate at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/) (2016 - 2020).

I major _cyberspace security_. (?) Okay, let me rephrase that: I hack your basic everyday deep learning models. It's not
that scary. I'm usually harmless. 😶‍🌫️

I do some open-source work - check [GitHub](https://github.com/spencerwooo) for that. I also write for
[少数派](https://sspai.com/u/spencerwoo/posts) - check their website for my previous articles.
